Lifecycle checks
================================================================================

When controlling containers (your service instances), Maestro can
perform additional checks to confirm that the service reached the
desired lifecycle state, in addition to looking at the state of the
container itself. A common use-case of this is to check for a given
service port to become available to confirm that the application
correctly started and is accepting connections.

Maestro can also execute checks before starting or stopping containers,
to confirm that the requested start or stop action should indeed take
place.

When starting containers, Maestro will first execute the ``pre-start``
lifecycle checks before starting the container. It will then execute all
the lifecycle checks for the ``running`` target state; all must pass for
the instance to be considered correctly up and running.

Similarly, before stopping a container, Maestro will first execute the
``pre-stop`` lifecycle checks. After stopping the container, Maestro
will execute all the ``stopped`` target state checks.

Checks can be defined via the ``lifecycle`` dictionary at the service
level, or for each declared instance of a service. If both are present,
all defined checks are executed; container-level lifecycle checks don't
override service-level checks, they add to them.

.. code-block:: yaml

  services:
    zookeeper:
      image: zookeeper:3.4.5
      lifecycle:
        running:
          - {type: tcp, port: client, max_wait: 10}
      instances:
        zk1:
          ship: host1
          ports: {client: 2181}
          lifecycle:
            running:
              - {type: exec, cmd: "python ./ruok.py", attempts: 10}

In the example above, Maestro will first perform a TCP port ping on the
``client`` port; when that succeeds, it will execute the hypothetical
``ruok.py`` script, which we can image as sending the ``ruok`` command
to the ZooKeeper instance, expecting the ``imok`` response back to
declare the service healthy and operational.

TCP port pinging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TCP port pinging (``type: tcp``) makes Maestro attempt to connect to the
configured port (by name), once per second until it succeeds or the
``max_wait`` value is reached (defaults to 300 seconds).

Assuming your instance declares a ``client`` named port, you can make
Maestro wait up to 10 seconds for this port to become available by doing
the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

  type: tcp
  port: client
  max_wait: 10

HTTP request
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This check (``type: http``) makes Maestro execute web requests to a
target, once per second until it succeeds or the ``max_wait`` value is
reached (defaults to 300 seconds).

Assuming your instance declares a ``admin`` named port that runs a
webserver, you can make Maestro wait up to 10 seconds for an HTTP
request to this port for the default path "/" to succeed by doing the
following:

.. code-block:: yaml

  type: http
  port: web
  max_wait: 10

Options:

- ``port``, named port for an instance or explicit numbered port
- ``host``, IP or resolvable hostname (defaults to ship.ip)
- ``match_regex``, regular expression to test response against (defaults
   to checking for HTTP 200 response code)
- ``path``, path (including querystring) to use for request (defaults to
   /)
- ``scheme``, request scheme (defaults to http)
- ``method``, HTTP method (defaults to GET)
- ``max_wait``, max number of seconds to wait for a successful response
   (defaults to 300)
- ``requests_options``, additional dictionary of options passed directly
   to python's requests.request() method (e.g. verify=False to disable
   certificate validation)

Script execution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Script execution (``type: exec``) makes Maestro execute the given
command, using the return code to denote the success or failure of the
test (a return code of zero indicates success, as per the Unix
convention). The command is executed a certain number of attempts
(defaulting to 180), with a delay between each attempt of 1 second. For
example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  type: exec
  command: "python my_cool_script.py"
  attempts: 30

The command's execution environment is extended with the same
environment that your running container would have, which means it
contains all the environment information about the container's
configuration, ports, dependencies, etc. You can then use Maestro guest
utility functions to easily grok that information from the environment
(in Python). See :doc:`orchestration` and :doc:`guest_functions` for
more information.

Note that the current working directory is never changed by Maestro
directly; paths to your scripts will be resolved from wherever you run
Maestro, not from where the environment YAML file lives.

Remote script execution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remote script execution (``type: rexec``) makes Maestro execute the given
script inside of running container, using the script output to denote the
success or failure of the test. Same as :doc:`Script execution`, the script
is executed a certain number of attempts (defaulting to 180), with a
delay between each attempt of 1 second. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  type: rexec
  command: "python my_cool_remote_script_in_container.py"
  attempts: 30

Also, the script's execution environment is extended with the same
environment that running container would have, which means it
contains all the environment information about the container's
configuration, ports, dependencies, etc. You can then use Maestro guest
utility functions to easily grok that information from the environment
(in Python). See :doc:`orchestration` and :doc:`guest_functions` for
more information.

Note that minimal ``api_version`` is '1.16'. See :doc:`environment` for
more information.
